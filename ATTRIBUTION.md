Wolf icon â€” attribution and usage

This project uses the "Wolf" icon from Flaticon for the site favicon.

Icon: Wolf (ID: 101711)
Author: Freepik
Source: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/wolf_101711
License: Free for personal and commercial use with attribution (Flaticon)

Required attribution (place in README or an attribution page):
"Wolf icon by Freepik from www.flaticon.com"

Suggested placement:
- Add this line to the project README (or an About/Attributions page).
- Keep a copy of the original icon in `public/` (for example `public/favicon.png`).

How to use as a favicon:
1. Download the PNG or SVG from the Flaticon page linked above.
2. Put the file in `public/` as `favicon.png` (or create `favicon.ico` if you prefer the .ico format).
3. The app's `app/head.tsx` already includes a link tag to `/favicon.png`.

Notes:
- If you remove the attribution, upgrade to a Flaticon Premium plan or contact Flaticon for a license.
- Keep the author and source URL intact to comply with the license.
