# AI-Memory Checkpoint

**⚠️ CRITICAL: THIS FILE IS READ-ONLY ⚠️**
**DO NOT MODIFY THIS PROMPT FILE. It is a template for agent workflows.**
**All work, plans, and context must be saved to AI-Memory/, NOT here.**


This prompt guides a comprehensive review and update of all memory bank files, captures recent progress, documents decisions, and generates a commit message summarizing the session.

## Instructions

Run this checkpoint at the end of a coding session or when significant work has been completed.

### Step 1: Review Current State

1. **Read all memory files** in this order:
   - `AI-Memory/productContext.md` - Understand the project scope
   - `AI-Memory/activeContext.md` - Current goals and blockers
   - `AI-Memory/systemPatterns.md` - Architectural patterns
   - `AI-Memory/decisionLog.md` - Past decisions
   - `AI-Memory/progress.md` - Recent work

2. **Gather session context**:
   - Review recent git changes: `git status` and `git diff`
   - Check for new or modified files in key directories:
     - `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`
     - Configuration files (`.github/`, `.vscode/`, root configs)
   - Note any test runs, builds, or deployments attempted

### Step 2: Update Memory Files

Update each memory file based on recent work:

#### activeContext.md
- Update **Current Goals** using `#MemoryManagement updateContext`
- Update **Current Blockers** with any unresolved issues
- Remove completed goals
- Add new goals discovered during this session

#### progress.md
- Move completed items using `#MemoryManagement updateProgress`
- Update "Doing" with current in-progress work
- Update "Next" with planned upcoming tasks
- Keep entries concise and timestamped

#### decisionLog.md
- Add decisions using `#MemoryManagement logDecision`
- Format: `| YYYY-MM-DD | Decision | Rationale |`

#### systemPatterns.md
- Document new patterns using `#MemoryManagement updateSystemPatterns`
- Update existing patterns if they evolved
- Categories:
  - **Architectural Patterns**: High-level system design
  - **Design Patterns**: Code organization and structure
  - **Common Idioms**: Project-specific conventions

#### productContext.md
- Update using `#MemoryManagement updateProductContext` if core features changed
- Add new libraries or technologies to Technical Stack
- Update overview if project scope shifted

### Step 3: Review Workflow and Instruction Files

Check if any workflow or instruction files need updates:

1. **Review `.github/workflows/`** for CI/CD changes
2. **Review `.vscode/settings.json`** and `mcp.json` for tooling updates
3. **Review root configuration files**:
   - `package.json` - dependency changes
   - `next.config.js` - build configuration
   - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript settings
   - `jest.config.cjs`, `playwright.config.ts` - testing configs

4. **Document recommendations**:
   - Workflow improvements discovered
   - Configuration optimizations
   - Tooling enhancements
   - Process refinements

### Step 4: Generate Summary Report

Create a structured summary:

```markdown
## Checkpoint Summary

### Session Overview
[Brief description of work completed]

### Files Modified
- [List key files changed]

### Decisions Made
- [List major decisions from this session]

### Progress Updates
**Completed:**
- [Items moved to Done]

**In Progress:**
- [Current work]

**Blocked:**
- [Any blockers identified]

### Recommendations
- [Workflow improvements]
- [Configuration updates]
- [Process changes]

### Next Steps
- [Immediate next actions]
- [Future work to consider]
```

### Step 5: Generate Commit Message

Based on the session summary, generate a conventional commit message:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, build, ci, perf

**Guidelines:**
- Subject: Imperative mood, max 72 characters
- Body: Explain what and why (not how)
- Footer: Breaking changes, issue references

**Example:**
```
chore(memory): update memory bank checkpoint workflow

- Added comprehensive checkpoint prompt for session reviews
- Updated progress tracking with recent test coverage work
- Documented Next.js 15.5.6 build blocker decision
- Enhanced system patterns with R2 fallback details

Related to ongoing gallery and deployment workflow improvements.
```

### Step 6: Validation

Before completing:

- [ ] All memory files have current dates
- [ ] DecisionLog entries follow table format
- [ ] Progress items are timestamped
- [ ] Active blockers are clearly documented
- [ ] System patterns reflect current architecture
- [ ] Commit message follows conventional commits format
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable and specific

## Usage

To run this checkpoint:

1. Say "Checkpoint" or "Run checkpoint" to the assistant
2. The assistant will execute all steps above
3. Review the generated summary and commit message
4. Manually commit using the provided message, or edit as needed

## Output Format

The assistant should respond with:

1. **Status**: `[MEMORY BANK: UPDATING]` at start
2. **Updates**: Confirmation of each file updated
3. **Summary**: Structured session summary
4. **Commit Message**: Ready-to-use git commit message
5. **Final Status**: `[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]`

This checkpoint ensures consistent project memory maintenance and provides clear session documentation for future reference.
