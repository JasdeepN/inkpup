# Deep Think & Research Prompt

**⚠️ CRITICAL: THIS FILE IS READ-ONLY ⚠️**
**DO NOT MODIFY THIS PROMPT FILE. It is a template for agent workflows.**
**All work, plans, and context must be saved to AI-Memory/, NOT here.**


## Purpose

This prompt facilitates deep research and analysis **before** planning begins. Use it to thoroughly understand problems, explore solutions, and gather context that will inform the Plan and Execute phases.

**Workflow Integration:**
```
Think (Research & Analysis) → Plan (Breakdown & Tasks) → Execute (Implementation)
                ↓
        Memory Management (Context Storage)
```

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Problem Understanding

1. **Define the Challenge**
   - What is the core problem or opportunity?
   - What are the constraints and requirements?
   - What does success look like?

2. **Use #DeepThink for Structured Analysis**
   ```
   #DeepThink analyze <problem statement>
   ```
   - Break down the problem into components
   - Identify assumptions and edge cases
   - Map dependencies and relationships
   - Consider multiple perspectives

3. **Capture Context**
   - Current system state
   - Related decisions from #MemoryManagement
   - Existing patterns from systemPatterns.md
   - Active blockers from activeContext.md

**Memory Action:**
```
#MemoryManagement updateContext "Researching: <problem statement>"
```

---

1. **Internal Knowledge Review**
   - Query #MemoryManagement for:
     - Related past decisions (decisionLog.md)
     - Existing system patterns (systemPatterns.md)
     - Previous similar work (progress.md)
     - Product context (productContext.md)

2. **External Research (when needed)**
   ```
   #WebResearch <specific technical query>
   ```
   - Best practices and methodologies

   - Team expertise and capacity
   - Timeline and urgency
   - SEO/Performance requirements (for web projects)

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential blockers
   - Consider failure modes
   - Plan mitigation strategies
   - Estimate effort and complexity

**Memory Action:**
```
#MemoryManagement updateSystemPatterns "<Pattern Name>" "<Pattern Description with trade-offs>"
```
