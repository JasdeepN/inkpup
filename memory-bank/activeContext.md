# Active Context

## Current Focus
- [CONTEXT:2025-11-22] Completed Plan.prompt.md workflow for Animation Phase 1 - CSS Micro-interactions
- Created comprehensive implementation plan with 41 actionable tasks across 7 components
- Plan document saved to memory-bank/plan-animation-phase1-2024-11-22.md
- 6 major components: Button Press, Input Focus, Success States, Card Hover, Navigation Polish, Theme Toggle
- Ready to begin implementation following Execute.prompt.md workflow
- Implementation order prioritized: Buttons → Inputs → Navigation → Cards → Success → Theme → Documentation
- Performance budget defined: <5KB CSS increase, 60fps maintained, Lighthouse ≥95
- [CONTEXT:2025-11-22] Previously completed: Animation research following Think.prompt.md workflow
- Research brief: memory-bank/research-animations-2024-11-22.md (12.5KB with 4-phase strategy)
- [CONTEXT:2025-11-20] Completed unification of glassmorphism styles across the application.
- Established `.glass-panel` and `.btn--glass` as the standard reusable classes for the "futuristic glass" aesthetic (Image 2).
- Refactored `PricingEstimator`, `PricingPage`, and `LoginForm` to use these unified classes.

## Recent Changes
- **Refactor**: Extracted `.hero-path-card` styles into a reusable `.glass-panel` class in `app/globals.scss`.
- **Refactor**: Created `.btn--glass` for consistent glass buttons.
- **Update**: Replaced ad-hoc Tailwind glass styles (`bg-white/10`, `backdrop-blur-lg`, etc.) with `.glass-panel` and `.btn--glass` in:
  - `components/PricingEstimator.tsx`
  - `app/pricing/page.tsx`
  - `components/admin/LoginForm.tsx`
- [CONTEXT:2025-11-20] Fixed regression where particle background was not visible.
  - Removed aggressive mobile check in `ParticlesBackground.tsx` (was disabling on <640px).
  - Reduced glass blur (`--glass-blur-md`) from 14px to 10px to improve visibility of particles behind glass panels.
  - Explicitly set `.site-content` background to transparent.
- [CONTEXT:2025-11-20] Completed comprehensive glassmorphism refactor across all pages.
  - Updated `app/globals.scss` to apply `.glass-panel` via `@extend` to:
    - `.service-explainer__card` (Home)
    - `.flash-pricing`, `.flash-card` (Flash)
    - `.custom-step`, `.custom-pricing__card`, `.custom-showcase__item` (Custom Design)
  - Removed opaque section backgrounds to reveal particles.
  - Refactored `app/about/page.tsx` and `app/contact/page.tsx` to use `.glass-panel`.

## Active Decisions
- **Design System**: Use global CSS classes (`.glass-panel`, `.btn--glass`) for complex visual effects like glassmorphism to ensure consistency, rather than repeating Tailwind utilities.
- **Aesthetic**: "Futuristic Glass" (Image 2) is the standard: high blur, saturation, contrast, layered gradients, and a highlight overlay.

## Current State
- Build passing.
- CSS unified for glass elements.

## Current Blockers

- None

## Todo
- [x] Unify Glassmorphism Styles
  - Refactor codebase to unify glassmorphism styles using a shared .glass-panel class based on the futuristic 'Image 2' design.
  - [x] Update .glass-panel to use richer background variables for dark mode to ensure visibility against dark body.
  - [x] Add subtle background gradient to .particles-wrapper to restore depth.
